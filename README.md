#Employee Tracker

This appplication uses DBeaver and SQL to enable the user to track employees for their company. Upon running the program via node server.js, the application will return an initial inquirer prompt: View Departments, View Roles, View Employees, and Add a Department.
From there, the inquirer package can enable the user to print out a model of the database, or edit the database directly.
